# Sonar-Mine-vs-Rock-Detection
This is a machine-learning model that predicts the Rock and the Mine using logistic regression. Which can be used in Submarines and Naval Ships for detection of the Mines inside the ocean  
I created this model which, while sending a Sonar signal receives some data in return when it comes in contact with some object on its way. By the data it receives, this model then predicts whether the object is a Mine or just a Rock. Which is useful in Naval ships and Submarines.
**This model includes:-**
a) Data Collection and Data Processing.
b) Training and Testing of Model.
c) Using Logistic Regression.
d) Model Evaluation.
e) Making of the Predictive System.
This model is based on Logistic Regression which is a part of the Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm
**The Libraries Used for this Model are:-**
Numpy, 
Pandas, 
train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection, 
LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear_model, 
accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics
